# KeyRemapper

Small python project to remap keyboard keys.

I wrote this project for multiplayer remote-play games on steam, where you essentially have to share the same keyboard with other players. This way, multiple players can have the same keybindings.


### Configuration
- After running main.py for the first time, a config.yaml file will be created in the root of the repository.
- Here you can decide which keys are remapped, and what they are remapped to.
- You can also specify if key presses are shown in the terminal.
