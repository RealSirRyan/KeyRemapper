# KeyRemapper

Small python project to remap keyboard keys.

I wrote this project for multiplayer remote-play games on steam, where you essentially have to share the same keyboard with other players. This way, multiple players can have the same keybindings.

On Linux, you have to use sudo inorder for the script to work.

### Configuration
- After running main.py for the first time, a config.yaml file will be created in the root of the repository.
- Here you can decide which keys are remapped, and what they are remapped to.
- You can also specify if key presses are shown in the terminal.
